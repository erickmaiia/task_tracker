# Task Tracker CLI Application

## Overview
This repository is designed to help me practice the backend roadmap from [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/). It is a beginner-friendly challenge to build a command-line interface (CLI) application for managing tasks. The project supports adding, updating, deleting, and viewing tasks with various statuses (e.g., todo, in-progress, done). It is an excellent way to enhance skills such as:

- Handling user inputs from the command line
- Working with the file system
- Managing JSON data

## Features
The Task Tracker CLI provides the following functionalities:

- **Add a Task**: Create a new task with a description.
- **Update a Task**: Modify the description of an existing task.
- **Delete a Task**: Remove a task by its ID.
- **Mark as In Progress**: Update a task’s status to "in-progress."
- **Mark as Done**: Update a task’s status to "done."
- **List Tasks**:
  - List all tasks
  - List tasks by status (todo, in-progress, done)
